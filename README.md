# Joystick-controlled-Transfer-Stage
This repository contains python code to use a joystick and a GUI to control the transfer stage built by Thorlabs hardwares inside a traditional glove box remotely. The general idea is to achieve a "semi-automated transfer stage in glove box for air sensitive 2D materials". With the current version, you can freely use a joystick plus the side assist of a GUI to control the whole transfer process semi-automatically.

The code mainly uses the package ctypes, which is a typical python package to exploit C++ commands. It is divided into several parts: connectivity.py to set the connection with the devices, movement.py to perform jogging, driving, stopping, etc. movements, position.py to report the real-time position of devices, camera.py to connect the camera and manipulate images in real-time, heater.py to connect and manipulate the heater LabVIEW vi, GUI.py to set up the joystick-device thread and the GUI-device thread, while main.py conclude all these programs and perform the final executation. globals.py and maths.py are axuiliary codes.

The hardwares are Thorlabs KDC motors and KIM piezo, which needs to be called by its original .dll files. The joystick is a Xbox 360 wirelss joystick. The camera is a Basler Ace acA1920-40uc camera.
